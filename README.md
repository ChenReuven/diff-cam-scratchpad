# diff-cam-scratchpad

Various demos using `getUserMedia()` and diff-cam-engine (https://github.com/lonekorean/diff-cam-engine).

### /simple-cam

Very basic demo showing how to access the webcam.

### /image-diff

Web app that accepts two images via drag-and-drop, then lets you diff them to see any pixels that are not the same.

### /diff-cam-example

Watches a live stream from the webcam, showing a real-time motion heatmap with a score indicating how much motion is present.

### /turret-security

A "security" demo that watches a live stream from the webcam, drawing a box around any motion it sees, with accompanying audio cues. Turret can be disabled by "hitting" it on screen.
